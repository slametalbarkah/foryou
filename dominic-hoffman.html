            Dominic Hoffman (born October 30, 1962) is an American actor and playwright. He is known for his recurring roles on The Shield as Louis Sperling, A Different World as Whitley's boyfriend, Julian Day, and Grey's Anatomy as Dr. Jeff Russell.<br/><br/>He is also an accomplished theater actor and playwright, earning Ovation awards in 2000 for his one-man show "Uncle Jacques' Symphony," a play that celebrates humanity as a musical metaphor. Its participants are a group of singular characters, all performed by Hoffman, with minimal alteration, played to maximum effect. Men and women, young and old, of different cultures and beliefs vividly come together on stage for ninety minutes. Their personal rhythms, unique harmonies, and the familiar melody of their stories combine to form a symphony of life. Ovation awards for best actor in a play, writing, and best world premiere.<br/><br/>Hoffman is also a distinguished audiobook narrator, winning the 2017 Audie Award for Literary Fiction or Classics for his rendition of  Yaa Gyasi's Homegoing. He has also been a finalist for two other Audie Awards and an Odyssey Award.
