            Melting Away (Hebrew: נמס בגשם, Names Ba-Geshem) is a 2012 Israeli drama film written by Billy Ben-Moshe and directed by Doron Eran, starring Hen Yanni in the lead role. This is the first Israeli feature film deals with parents coping with their transgender child. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>The idea for the movie was conceived after the 2009 Tel Aviv gay centre shooting.  Doron Eran and Billy Ben-Moshe watched TV and heard that parents refused to visit their injured kids at the hospital because they were afraid that their friends and relatives would know that their son is homosexual or their daughter is lesbian.  The director Doron Eran made auditions for 120 actors until he found Hen Yanni, the actress he chooses for the lead role.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>Shlomo Shapira discovers one day that his teenage son Asaf likes to wear women's clothes. With the silent consent of his wife Galia, he decides to teach his son a lesson. On a rainy night Asaf returns to his parents' home after a party but they refuse to open the door, even though he cries. Shlomo tell Galia that after Asaf discovers the hard world outside he will come back home and will forget all of this nonsense, but he was wrong. Four years later, Shlomo is dying from cancer and Galia turns to Eytan, a private investigator to find her son and tell him about his father.
