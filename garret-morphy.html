            Garret Morphy (c. 1655 – c. 1716) was an Irish painter who is considered to be Ireland's first recorded professional artist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Little is known about Garret Morphy's origins and personal life. He is assumed to be of Irish birth, however there were Morphys in London, Dublin and elsewhere in Ireland in the 17th century. In his will he was described as "of the city of Dublin, painter". The first documented mention of him is in 1673 when he was an assistant to the Catholic artist Edmund Ashfield, in London. At this time he was probably about 18 years old.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>Morphy's earliest work are from around 1676 and his style of portrait painting suggests he studied under the Flemish portrait painter, Gaspar Smitz, who painted the Irish aristocracy in the 1660s and 1670s. Morphy was a Catholic and was known to move between London and Dublin, painting portraits of established Catholic families, the colonial hierarchy and army officers. It is thought he may have visited the Netherlands and France as his paintings reflected the newest artistic trends. Morphy appears to have moved around constantly during this period, making it difficult to ascertain how much time he spent in Ireland.
