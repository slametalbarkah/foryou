            A split-twig figurine is one of many artifacts located around several Western states of the United States, specifically Arizona, Utah, Nevada and California. They are made from flexible wooden twigs, such as willow, and are split down the middle and wrapped carefully, usually into animal shapes. There are several variations in wrapping styles across the states, and are thought to have had various functions as well in past societies. They have been radiocarbon dated, among other techniques, to between 2,000 and 4,000 years ago. This places split-twig figurines around roughly the Archaic and Late Archaic era of North America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Types ==<br/><br/>There are two distinct styles of figurines, which served two different functions, one is considered to be religious or ritualistic (such as totems) and the other was possibly a children's toy. The term ‘totem’ by definition can vary, but as it is used by anthropologists, it is done so to show the natural object, such as a plant or animal, that a social group uses to identify its members. Also, the image or object that said group creates to symbolize their relationship with the natural species. In this case, the figurines are believed to symbolize animals within the geographic area in which they were found. There are two different styles of split-twig figurine construction; one named the Grand Canyon and the other the Green River.
