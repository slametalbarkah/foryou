            Wildwood station is a bus station, and former train station, in Wildwood, Florida. It serves Amtrak Thruway buses and formerly served trains for Amtrak and other rail companies. The station is located on 601 North Main Street (US 301) in Wildwood, Florida. Along with the northern terminus of Florida's Turnpike, the station gave Wildwood a reason to refer to itself as "The Crossroads of Florida."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The station was built in 1947 by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL) in the art deco architectural style, and is located on what is today CSX's S-Line, which runs along the west side of the building. This segment of the S-Line is officially named the Wildwood Subdivision. The station served SAL's Orange Blossom Special, Silver Meteor, Silver Star, Sunland and Palmland. It was a few miles south of this location at Coleman that the SAL mainlines split: the main sections, or "east coast" sections of the Silver Meteor, Silver Star, Sunland, and Palmland travelled along SAL's mainline to their station in Miami, while the secondary sections, or "west coast" sections of the Silver Meteor, Silver Star, Sunland, and Palmland travelled along SAL's mainline to their station in Tampa. These "west coast" trains also continued in different sections to St. Petersburg with a stop in Clearwater, and Venice with stops in Bradenton and Sarasota.<br/><br/>In 1967, after the merger of Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) and the SAL into the new Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, the Florida Special,  Silver Meteor, Silver Star, and Palmland made stops at the station from 1967 to 1971, while the Sunland was discontinued by SCL in 1968.
