<h1>Sarath Ambepitiya</h1>
            
            Sarath Ambepitiya (November 19, 1946  – November 19, 2004) was a Sri Lankan jurist. He was serving as a Judge of the Colombo High Court when he was assassinated. The assassination, orchestrated by a drug lord sentenced by the judge, gripped the nation and forced the government to crack down on organized crime.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education ==<br/><br/>Educated at the Royal College, Colombo, Ambepitiya entered the Sri Lanka Law College to study law and was called to the bar as an attorney at law.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>After practicing law for some time, he joined the judiciary in 1977 and served as a Magistrate in many parts of the island. Later he was appointed Chief Magistrate of Colombo and then Additional District Judge of Colombo. Ambepitiya's first appointment as a High Court Judge was in Galle, after which he was appointed as a High Court Judge in Colombo. He was noted for his fearlessness in rendering strong judgments and taking up cases that other judges feared to adjudicate upon. Ambepitiya presided over many important criminal cases including the Central Bank bombing case.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Assassination ==<br/><br/>Ambepitiya was shot dead by assassins at his official residence along with his bodyguard, Police Inspector Upali Bandara, on November 19, 2004.
