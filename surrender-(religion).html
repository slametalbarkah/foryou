            To surrender in spirituality and religion means that a believer completely gives up their own will and subjects his thoughts, ideas, and deeds to the will and teachings of a higher power. It may also be contrasted with submission. Surrender is willful acceptance and yielding to a dominating force and their will.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Christianity ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In Christianity, the first main principle of surrender is "Dying to Self", or "The Carrying of Your Cross", allowing Christ to reign and rule in the order of how one's life is carried out, illustrated in the following passages: <br/><br/><br/><br/> Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any [man] will come after me let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.<br/><br/>Greater love hath no man than this,that a man lay down his life for his friends.<br/><br/>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.<br/><br/>Another principle central to the Christian concept of surrender is the concept of surrender to God's Will. Surrendering to God's will entails both the surrender of our will to His, in His sovereignty over all things, in which His ways of operating and thinking prevails over humanity's and Satan's. Secondarily, the surrender of one's will is evidenced by the acknowledgement of God's will for our personal lives in even the smallest decisions. This is done through putting personal desire aside in favor of God's perfect will for our lives.
