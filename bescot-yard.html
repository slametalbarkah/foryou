            Bescot Yard is a railway yard in Bescot, a suburb of Walsall in the West Midlands, operated by DB Cargo UK. The yard is the major freight yard of the region, handling all of the rail freight movements and most of the railfreight traffic around the West Midlands.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Bescot is on the Chase Line between Birmingham New Street and Walsall, part of the former Grand Junction Railway, opened in 1837. It was built to handle the coal and industrial traffic associated with the West Midlands. In April 1966, a remodelled Bescot Yard was opened which was capable of handling over 4,000 wagons daily.<br/><br/>Traffic from the West Midlands Domestic Coal network was diverted away from Bescot to Washwood Heath sidings in July 1987. This allowed for extra capacity at Bescot.<br/><br/>Bescot TMD is to the north-west of the yard. This entire complex of track is clearly visible from the northern end of the M6 and M5 motorway junction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Present ==<br/><br/>After closure of the 1950s-developed hump shunting yard, freight declined significantly during  the Great Recession, and the associated Bescot TMD now carries no allocation of locomotives. Washwood Heath sidings were closed to freight trains in the latter half of 2008 and all residual services were transferred back to Bescot yard.
