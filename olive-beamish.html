            Olive Beamish (17 June 1890 – 14 April 1978) was an Irish-born suffragette, who wore a Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) badge whilst still at school, and became involved in the militant suffragette movement, including attacking postboxes and arson. Beamish was also known as "Phyllis Brady". Beamish was imprisoned and force-fed and was one of the first to be released under the "Cat and Mouse" Act and later sentenced to 18 months with hard labour.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Agnes Olive Beamish was born in Cork in Ireland. Her father was a Protestant farmer. She had brothers. Her parents supported their daughter joining Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1906 and she wore their badge to school, whilst living in Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, England, where they were had moved to by 1901. Beamish felt the inferior status of women when her brothers were able to engage in politics for the 1905 election, saying "I felt the position keenly, that I would never be equal to them in the political world, and I also realised the inferior position of women, everywhere." Beamish studied at Girton College Cambridge, mathematics and economics in 1912.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Suffrage activism ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Beamish began to organise for the WSPU at Battersea London as well as in the East End where she attacked a pillarbox. On 19 March 1913, Trevethan, a mansion house in Egham, Surrey (whose owner Lady White was out of the country) was ruined in an arson attack and fire, and messages were found in the garden referring to suffragette slogans, including "Stop torturing our comrades in prison" and "Votes for Women".
