            Porto Digital, also known as The Porto Digital Science Park, is an initiative in Recife, Brazil that aims to foster technological innovation in the Northeast region of Brazil. It began in July 2000 on the island of Recife Antigo, where the port from the time of the 17th century Dutch occupation of the area was located. Porto Digital has grown steadily since 2000, reporting more than 330 technology companies that employ more than 11,000 people and housing 800 entrepreneurs within the zone by 2020.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History and development ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Porto Digital was created in Recife in July 2000 as a result of a joint effort of the Pernambuco state government, private sector and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). Most of the funding for the creation of Porto Digital came from the privatization of CELPE, the state's electricity company. The companies and incubators that form the science park are mostly housed in buildings on the island that is known as Old Recife. <br/><br/>Porto Digital hosts CESAR, Brazil's most innovative R&amp;D institute according to a federal government assessment in 2004. The science park was evaluated as the largest in Brazil in 2005 by AT Kearney and in 2007, 2011 and 2015 won the prize for best Brazilian Science Park, given by the Brazilian Association of Science Parks and Business Incubators (ANPROTEC). It was described in 2013 as a coordinated effort between the federal and state governments, becoming an economic keystone in Pernambuco state since its start in 2000.<br/><br/>Porto Digital is a member of the International Association of Science Parks and Areas of Innovation (IASP), an NGO in special consultative status with the UN, and hosted the association's 30th World Conference, "IASP Recife" in 2013.
