<h1>Jagabandhu Patnaik</h1>
            
            Jagabandhu Patnaik (or Jagu Dewan) was the Dewan of Porahat in Singhbhum, village Kera (now in Jharkhand). He served as the Dewan under Raja Achyut Singh and his successor Raja Arjun Singh.<br/><br/>Together, they took part in anti-British activities during the 1857 Indian rebellion of Independence. The Kol rebellion of Singhbhum in 1831 was the outcome of the inspiration and instigation of Jagabandhu Patnaik more popularly known as Jagu Dewan to the Kols. Jagu Dewan was considered a dangerous enemy by the British government, a ransom was also put up by the British government for his capture.<br/><br/>In the 1857 war he encouraged Raja Arjun Singh to raise his arms against the British. Jagu Dewan with a strong Kol force and an army of 300 Odia soldiers rose against the British and occupied Chakradharpur, he became the commander of the Chakradharpur Fort and was assisted by Raja Arjun Singh's brother Raghdeo in his resistance against the British. Later the British force under Lt. Birch reoccupied Chakradharpur and Jagu Dewan was captured and executed by the British Authorities. Dewan Jagabandhu Patnaik's son Balmukunda Patnaik had also conspired against the British by helping Veer Surendra Sai and his rebels in their freedom struggle against the British.
