            Andreas Horn is a German neuroscientist and Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham. His research has focused on mapping deep brain stimulation outcomes onto networks of the human brain. Horn's work has been featured by media outlets such as CNN, Newsweek or Fox News and he has been considered among the 'World's Highly Cited Researchers' by Clarivate.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Education and early career ==<br/><br/>Horn studied medicine at University of Freiburg and received his MD in 2012. He then pursued a PhD in Medical Neurosciences at Charité Berlin which he completed in 2016. After working in several postdoctoral roles, he was enrolled into the Emmy Noether Program by the German Research Foundation and started a laboratory at Charité in 2018. In 2022, he became Associate Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School and affiliated with Brigham and Women's and Massachusetts General Hospital.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Research contributions ==<br/><br/>Horn is known for his work in brain circuit mapping and neuromodulation. He developed methods to localize deep brain stimulation electrodes and to estimate networks stimulated by them. His research has also explored how brain stimulation sites and lesions correlate with specific brain circuits, providing insights into various neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, obsessive-compulsive-disorder, Alzheimer's Disease, and dystonia.
