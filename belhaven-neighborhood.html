            Belhaven Neighborhood or "The Greater Belhaven Area", often simply called "Belhaven", is a neighborhood located in Jackson, Mississippi. Belhaven Neighborhood is named after the home of Confederate veteran Jones S. Hamilton, which became the namesake of Belhaven University. Belhaven is a historic district and one of Jackson's oldest neighborhoods and cultural centers as well as home to many of the city's oldest houses and buildings. Many popular and successful locally owned businesses are located within Belhaven, including a number of restaurants, shops, stores, and a bed and breakfast inn. Belhaven is considered to be one of the most architecturally diverse neighborhoods in the United States, much of which can be seen through the Greater Belhaven Neighborhood Architectural Tour.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Belhaven Subdivisions ==<br/><br/>Belhaven is subdivided into two major areas: Belhaven and Belhaven Heights. The borders of Belhaven are generally considered to be Woodrow Wilson Avenue to the North, Interstate 55 (I-55) to the East, Fortification Street to the South, and State Street to the West. The borders of Belhaven Heights are generally considered to be Fortification Street to the North, Interstate 55 (I-55) to the East, High Street to the South, and State Street to the West. The Greater Belhaven Neighborhood Foundation represents the citizens of both areas and their interests. Belhaven Heights is noticeably more hilly than Belhaven, although both areas are among the highest elevations within Jackson.
