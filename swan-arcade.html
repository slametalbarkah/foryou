            The Swan Arcade was a four-storey building located between Market Street and Broadway, Bradford, England and stood opposite the Wool Exchange.  The Bradford Beck ran beneath.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Architecture and history ==<br/><br/>The Swan Arcade was designed in the Italianate style by the architects Milnes and France, and was built between 1877 and 1880 from Bolton Woods Stone by J and W Beanland, a firm instrumental in shaping Bradford’s built environment, at a cost of £160,000.  The gates were made by Hodkinson and Co, and Taylor and Parsons.<br/><br/>It was opened in 1880 by the Mayor of Bradford and local MP Angus Holden, and named after the White Swan Inn, which had previously stood on the same site.  The west wing, by John Moulson and sons was added in 1881.  It covered a 2,630-square yard site.<br/><br/>The Arcade had six grand entrances, the main ones on Market Street incorporating graceful swans in stone and ironwork and Charles Street, and, within, four linked arcades with wrought iron glazed roofs and accommodation for offices and stock rooms.<br/><br/>The ground floor occupants included a cigar merchant, a cabinet maker and two tailors.<br/><br/>At the start of the 20th century, mill owners established offices in the arcade, but after many years it reverted to its original role as a shopping centre.
