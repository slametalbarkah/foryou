            Neil Wighton Naismith, PhC  MPS FSHP AM (13 November 1935 – 26 May 2002), was an Australian pharmacist whose career in hospital pharmacy commenced in 1960. He served as Director of Pharmacy at The Royal Melbourne Hospital from 1967–1997.<br/><br/>Naismith introduced innovative changes to hospital pharmacy practice that provided a foundation for services that are now widely established. Neil Naismith implemented new drug distribution systems and presented a paper at the 1969 Federal Conference of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia (SHPA), entitled A New Look at Hospital Packaging, which provided a stimulus for changes to the methods of purchasing and packaging used by hospital pharmacies. Neil was awarded the Allen and Hanbury Medal of Merit in 1975 in recognition of his work in promoting the concepts of unit dose and unit dose packaging.<br/><br/>In 1972, Naismith's service to the advancement of pharmacy practice was also recognised by the Churchill Trust with the award of a Churchill Fellowship, and he was the first Australian hospital pharmacist to receive this award.<br/><br/>Naismith established the first formalised drug information service in Australia at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, and undertook cost-effectiveness studies to demonstrate the value of ward pharmacy services and the role of full-time ward pharmacists.<br/><br/>Neil Naismith’s career included 40 years membership of SHPA where he served on the Federal Council (1967–1973 and 1993–2000) and on the Victorian Branch Committee for over 15 years. In 1965, in conjunction with Fred J Boyd, Neil launched the Australian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy, and from 1965–1971 was the inaugural administrator of the journal. He also co-authored The History of the Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia in Victoria published in 1991.
