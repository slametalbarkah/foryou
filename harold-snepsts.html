            Harold John Snepsts (Latvian: Harolds Džons Šnepsts, born October 24, 1954) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who spent 17 seasons in the National Hockey League between 1975 and 1991, including two stints with the Vancouver Canucks. Snepsts featured in the 1982 Stanley Cup Finals with the Canucks.<br/><br/>Snepsts was born in Edmonton, Alberta and both of his parents came from Latvia. He is one of the most popular players in the history of the Canucks, the club where he spent the majority of his career.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>A "stay-at-home defender," Snepsts played his junior hockey for the Edmonton Oil Kings and was selected 59th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1974 NHL amateur draft. He made a strong impression during his first training camp, and appeared in 27 games for the Canucks in 1974–75, recording his first NHL goal. In 1975–76, he became a regular for the Canucks, appearing in 78 games and recording three goals and 18 points. He would quickly become a fan favourite for his hard-working, effective, blue-collar defensive game as well as his likeable personality and large moustache.<br/><br/>Through the late 1970s and early 1980s, Snepsts was Vancouver's most effective defender. His physical, error-free brand of hockey saw him selected to the NHL All-Star Game in 1977 and 1982, and he was named the club's top defender four times in five years between 1977 and 1982.
