The family moved to Scarsdale, New York where Stackhouse studied at the Steffi Nossen School of Dance. She graduated in 1954 from Scarsdale High School. On a scholarship to the American Dance Festival, Stackhouse first met Limón and also took classes from Martha Graham. She gained a bachelor's degree in dance from the University of Wisconsin in 1958. After moving to New York City, she taught dance at the New York Police Athletic League. Amongst her teachers while in New York were Merce Cunningham, Antony Tudor and Margaret Craske.
