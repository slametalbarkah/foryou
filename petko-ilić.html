            Petko Ilić (Serbian Cyrillic: Петко Илић; July 1886 – March 17, 1912) was a Serbian Chetnik commander active in Macedonia.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Ilić was born in Staro Nagoričane. He became a vojvoda in 1906.<br/><br/>Petko Ilić was born in July 1886, in Staro Nagoričane, a Serbian village that is primarily known for its Church of St. George built in 1071 and reconstructed between 1313 and 1318 by Serbian king Stefan Milutin. At the time of Petko Ilić's birth that Christian territory was still under the long occupation of the Ottoman Empire. His inheritance, from generations of Serbian ancestors, was hate of Turkish tyranny and the example of many forefathers who fought against it futilely. When he was six-years-old he saw his family members dragged from home in chains by Turkish soldiers and Bashi-bazouks, lashed and imprisoned, on a charge of treason. As a youngster of 16 in 1903, he joined what he thought was a Serbian četa (band of freedom fighters), led by Valko Mandarčev, a Bulgarian pretending to be a Serb sympathizer. In the winter of 1904 Mandarčev's cheta met the komitadji of Bobi Stojcev, an IMRO commander, near Poreč, they were disarmed and liquidated.
