            Konstantin Aleksandrovich Trutovsky (Russian: Костантин Александрович Трутовский; 9 February 1826 – 29 March 1893) was a Russian genre painter and illustrator of works by Nikolai Gogol, Mikhail Lermontov, Ivan Krylov, author of paintings dedicated to life in Malorossiya, academician of the Imperial Academy of Arts, member of Société Royale Belge des Aquarellistes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>He was born in Kursk, Russian Empire in a Russian nobility family. His primary education was in Kharkiv, Russian Empire then, after his father's death, he was taken to Saint Petersburg in 1839, where he was enrolled at the Nikolaevsky Engineering Academy and his aptitude for drawing was first displayed.<br/><br/>He graduated in 1845, and began to attend classes at the Imperial Academy of Arts with Fyodor Bruni, intending to become a history painter. Soon, however, he discovered a preference for painting scenes from everyday life.<br/><br/>While there, he made the first known portrait of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, (his former fellow student at the engineering school), became involved in the Petrashevsky Circle and narrowly avoided arrest. In 1849 he returned to the relative safety of his family estate in Malorossiya, which soon passed to him, following his mother's death. He painted throughout the local Malorossian villages, visiting Saint Petersburg or Moscow only to arrange exhibitions.<br/><br/>In the early 1850s, he published an Album of Scenes of Malorossian Life and, in 1856, was awarded the title of "Free Artist". In the late 1850s, he toured Germany and became a corresponding member of the "Royal Society of Belgian Watercolorists".
