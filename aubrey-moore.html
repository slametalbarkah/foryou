            Aubrey Lackington Moore (1848–1890) was an English Anglo-Catholic priest and one of the first Christian Darwinians. He has been described as "the clergyman who more than any other man was responsible for breaking down the antagonisms towards Evolution then widely felt in the English Church".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Moore was born on 30 March 1848 in Camberwell, England, the second son of Daniel Moore, vicar of Holy Trinity, Paddington, and prebendary of St Paul's.<br/><br/>He was educated at St Paul's School from 1860 to 1867, which he left with an exhibition, matriculating as a commoner of Exeter College, Oxford, 1867, whence, after obtaining first-class honours in classical moderations and literae humaniores, he graduated B.A. in 1871 (M.A. 1874).<br/><br/>He was fellow of St John's College, Oxford, 1872–1876; became a lecturer and tutor (1874); was assistant tutor at Magdalen College (1875); and was rector of Frenchay, near Bristol, from 1876 to 1881, when he was appointed a tutor of Keble College.<br/><br/>He became examining chaplain to Bishops John Mackarness and William Stubbs of Oxford, select preacher at Oxford 1885–1886, Whitehall preacher 1887–1888, and hon. canon of Christ Church 1887. A few weeks before his death, he accepted an official fellowship as dean of divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford, and when nominated simultaneously to examine in the final honour schools of theology and literae humaniores, accepted the latter post.<br/><br/>He died after a very brief illness on 17 January 1890 and was buried in Holywell Cemetery.<br/><br/>At Oxford, Moore had a unique position as at once a theologian and a philosopher of recognised attainments in natural science, dealing fearlessly with the metaphysical and scientific questions affecting theology.
