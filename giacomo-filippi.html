            Giacomo Filippi (born 27 October 1975) is an Italian football coach and former defender.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>Filippi started his career with his hometown amateur club, Partinico Audace. In 1996, he moved into professionalism with then-Serie C2 club Ternana. In 1999, he was signed by Serie B club Treviso, playing three seasons as a regular for the Venetians (two of which were in the Italian second division).<br/><br/>He successively spent a number of seasons with different teams at Serie C1 and Serie C2 level until joining Trapani of Serie D in 2009; with Trapani, he won three promotions, all the way up to Serie B, as team captain under the management of Roberto Boscaglia. He retired in 2013, after winning promotion to Serie B.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Coaching career ==<br/><br/>After retiring as a player, he accepted to stay at Trapani as a youth coach for the Allievi team. In 2015, he was called by his former manager Roberto Boscaglia as his assistant at Brescia.<br/><br/>Successively, Filippi followed Boscaglia on all of his later coaching jobs at Novara, Brescia for a second time, Virtus Entella and, in 2020, Palermo.<br/><br/>On 27 February 2021, Filippi was promoted to head coach of Palermo after the Rosanero board decided to sack Boscaglia from his role. Under his tenure in the second half of the 2020–21 Serie C season, results significantly improved and Palermo manage to qualify to the promotion playoffs, from where they were eliminated in the third round by third-placed Avellino.
