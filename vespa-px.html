            The Vespa P/PX Series is a range of scooters manufactured by Piaggio under the Vespa brand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The Vespa PX was first presented in 1977 in Milan as the nuova linea model (new line). The Vespa was built with two drum brakes, a single-cylinder air cooled engine (aluminum head) and a steel chassis, but has been improved with a new front suspension and a revised rear axle for more stability. It was distributed as Vespa P 125 X and as Vespa P 200 E with an electronic ignition (E for Elettronica) and since 1978 as Vespa P 150 X. The PX 80 appeared in 1981 exclusively for the German market.<br/><br/>This electronic ignition was introduced to the other models, which then were called Vespa PX125E and Vespa PX150E, and in 1982 the Vespa P 200 E was called Vespa PX200E. In 1982, the Arcobaleno series was introduced (marketed outside of Italy as the Lusso series) with technological innovations such as separate lubrication and fuel gauges. In addition, the front brake pads were made to be self-centering, the wiring was altered for ease of maintenance, the same key was now used for the ignition and the steering lock, and several minor adjustments were made to the body. These included increasing the size of the glovebox, increasing the size of the rear mudguard, and a new horn grille.<br/><br/>In 1985 a sporty variant hit the market: The Vespa T5 Pole Position with almost 12 hp. In 1992, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Vespa, a scooter was offered with the T5 engine and the PX style body. This was marketed as the Vespa PX 125 T5 Classic.
