            Lodovico Mortara (16 April 1855 – 1 January 1937) was an Italian jurist, magistrate, and politician. He served as Minister of Justice with the first Nitti government.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and academic career ==<br/><br/>Born in Mantua into a Jewish family as an Austrian citizen, Mortara was the son of Marco Mortara (Mordechai), the senior rabbi of the community, and his wife Sara Castelfranco. After graduating in law from the University of Modena in 1874, he practised as a lawyer before embarking on an academic career. Beginning as a freelance lecturer in civil procedure in Bologna in 1882, he obtained the position of extraordinary professor in the Faculty of Law of the University of Pisa in 1886 soon after he published, at the age of thirty, a pamphlet on the politics of law: The Modern State and Justice. He became a full professor there in 1888.<br/><br/>His academic positions prompted him to write a number of teaching works, which went through several editions. These included the two volumes of his Manual of Civil Procedure (1887–1888) and both the Principles of Civil Procedure and the Institutions of the Judicial System (1890). In 1892, together with Carlo Francesco Gabba, he took over the direction of the magazine Giurisprudenza italiana, which he continued for forty-five years. In 1898, he moved to the Faculty of Law of Naples to take up the chair of civil procedure; in the same year he began publishing, in instalments, his commentary on the code and on the laws of civil procedure.
