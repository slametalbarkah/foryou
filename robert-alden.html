            Edwin Hyde "Robert" Alden (January 14, 1836 – May 6, 1911) was an American Congregational minister. He was one of the many real people upon whom Laura Ingalls Wilder based a character in the Little House on the Prairie series of books and the NBC television series of the same name.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life and work ==<br/><br/>Alden was born in Windsor, Vermont. He was the founding pastor of the First Congregational Church of Waseca, Minnesota in 1868, the first organized church in that town.  Alden was later the minister at the Congregational Church in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, which was described in the book "On the Banks of Plum Creek". He was a home missionary, having a church in the East, involved in planting new churches on the western frontier, such as the one in Walnut Grove which he founded in 1875. Charles and Caroline Ingalls were among the first baptized members.<br/><br/>When the Ingalls family left Walnut Grove, they were convinced they would never see him again, but he unexpectedly appeared in Dakota Territory, which Laura Ingalls Wilder mentioned in "By the Shores of Silver Lake". Alden held the first church service in De Smet in February 1880, in the surveyors' house where the Ingalls family was temporarily living.<br/><br/>In the time between these two meetings with the Ingalls family, Alden went further north in Dakota Territory to work for the United States government as an Indian Agent at Fort Berthold.
