            Plan Ávila is a military contingency plan by the Venezuelan Army to maintain public order in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas. The plan was first implemented in 1989 by the Carlos Andrés Pérez government in response to the Caracazo riots, where hundreds were killed by military and armed police. President Hugo Chávez also ordered activation of the plan in response to the 11 April 2002 Llaguno Overpass events, but high-ranking members of the Armed Forces refused to carry out the plan, wanting to avoid a massacre like the Caracazo.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Origin ===<br/><br/>Plan Ávila was created in the 1960s as a contingency plan if guerrilla forces were to overcome police and the national guard, requiring the Army of Venezuela to intervene. The plan was organized to have a lax structure, removing chains of command and grouping army troops into independent squads to combat potentially small, unorganized guerrilla groups.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Caracazo ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Plan Ávila was first implemented in 1989 by the government of Carlos Andrés Pérez, in response to riots, in an event which became known as the Caracazo; resulting with hundreds to thousands being killed by military and armed police.<br/><br/>On 27 August 2002, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that the 1989 implementation of Plan Ávila had resulted in massive human rights violations, and ordered the Venezuelan government to review its military contingency planning to conform to international human rights standards. In 2009, Venezuelan attorney general Luisa Ortega Díaz ordered the extradition of Pérez due to his implementation of the plan.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== 2002 Venezuelan coup attempt ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>The activation of Plan Ávila was ordered by then-President Hugo Chávez at midday on 11 April 2002, in response to the Llaguno Overpass events. The action was in violation of laws in the 1999 Venezuela Constitution created by Chávez that were in place to prevent another massacre like the Caracazo.
