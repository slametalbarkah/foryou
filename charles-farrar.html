            Charles Farrar is an American songwriter, composer, and producer, best known for his songwriting work with vocal groups SWV, 702, Today, and Shades. In the late 1990s/early 2000s, Farrar, alongside Troy Taylor, was a member of "The Characters": a production duo that worked on Boyz II Men's Cooleyhighharmony, as well as with Kenny Lattimore and numerous other artists.<br/><br/>In 2001, Farrar was nominated to serve on the board of directors for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP). He was also a part owner in New York City-area recording studio The Weight Room.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== The Characters ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Characters were a Grammy Award-winning American songwriting and production duo best known for their work with 1990s R&amp;B vocal groups such as Boyz II Men, Destiny's Child, and Riff. The pairing was formed when Troy Taylor, signed in early 1990 to a solo record deal with Motown, decided to instead explore songwriting and production for other artists with fellow songwriter and producer Farrar. After commencing work with Farrar, two of the songs originally created for Taylor's debut album were repurposed and placed onto Boyz II Men's acclaimed debut project Cooleyhighharmony. They would reunite with the group to create "Jezzebel" for 1994's Grammy-winning II album.<br/><br/>Several years later, solo R&amp;B artist Johntá Austin, working with the duo at the time to create his own debut project at the age of 13, was experiencing instability at RCA Records as a result of internal label politics. Austin was added to the writing team as an occasional member when he was subsequently dropped and his project was shelved, and their first writing collaborations as a trio resulted in "Realize" for Jason Weaver, "Here For You" for SWV's 1997 album Release Some Tension and hit single "Sweet Lady" for Tyrese Gibson.
