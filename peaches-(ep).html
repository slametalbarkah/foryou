"Vanilla" is an indie-pop genre song that combines drowsy guitar, bongo, and tropical synthesizer sounds, comparing the feeling of falling in love with a soft vanilla taste, and the repeated chorus doubles the dreamy atmosphere of the song. The song "Domino" was described R&amp;B hip-hop genre song with heavy bass, drums, and low-tone vocals which lyrically expresses that once it starts, let's move away from the gaze or worries of others and move as much as we want. "Come In" was described as a groovy hip-hop dance genre song that impresses the use of layered bases, synthesizers, and vocoders, with the lyrics that express the message of not hesitating in love and approaching boldly are eye-catching.
