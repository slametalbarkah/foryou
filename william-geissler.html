            William Hastie Geissler (1894 - 1963) was a Scottish artist known for his watercolours of the natural world. He was one of The Edinburgh School, and much of his earlier work came from sketching trips undertaken with other members of this group, though he himself is sometimes described as a "neglected" member. Although his natural preference lay with watercolour, often with gouache and pen and ink, several works in oil survive.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and education ==<br/><br/>William Geissler was the grandson of Paul Richard Geissler, who in the 1850s had emigrated from Hirschfeld, Saxony in Germany to Edinburgh, where he settled and married, pursuing a career as a music teacher for children of well-to-do families. Following the collapse of the City of Glasgow Bank in 1878, the financial conditions of Paul Richard's clients, as well as his own, became severely strained. As a result, he advised his own children to seek careers that guaranteed security. Thus it was that Hermann Richard Geissler became a railway clerk. Hermann married Jane Hastie on 26 September 1893, and William was born precisely nine months later. William was educated at James Gillespie's Primary School and Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh, where his precocious interest in drawing was remarked early on. After the drudgery of his father's generation William could begin to develop his inherited artistic talents.
