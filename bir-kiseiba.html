            Bir Kiseiba is a Neolithic archaeological site in Egypt, dating from approximately 11,000–5,000 BP, that lies approximately 250 km west of the Nile in Lower Nubia. Excavated by Fred Wendorf, Romauld Schild, and Angela Close, Bir Kiseiba, along with Nabta Playa, has some of the earliest evidence for food production, permanent settlement, and more diverse technologies as compared to sites from the Late Pleistocene. Wendorf and associates argue that cattle and pottery were here as early as any other place in Africa, although this assertion has been challenged.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Archaeology ==<br/><br/>Most of the studies in the Bir Kiseiba region relate to the beginning of the Holocene when there was a wet period from about 11–10,000 BP until 5000 BP. There were two digging seasons at Bir Kiseiba, one in 1979 and the second in 1980. A total of 13 localities were excavated, scattered among four dry lakes or playas in the Bir Kiseiba region.<br/><br/>Occupations from throughout the Early Holocene were studied; however, the most emphasis was put on earlier sites occupied before 6500 BP due to limited resources, the locations of many later sites along the margins of the basins, previous studies had already been done at the later sites, and only the earlier sites could provide data related to the appearance of cattle to the Sahara. The earliest known settlements in the area have been radiocarbon dated to between 9800 and 8900 BP. Artifacts from these settlements yielded the remains of cattle and also sherds of pottery with designs distantly related to the Early Khartoum styles.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Faunal Remains ===<br/><br/>Many faunal remains were found at each site and include turtles, lizards, frogs, birds, desert hedgehogs, hares, lesser gerbils, striped ground squirrels, elephants, dorcas gazelle, and large bovids that Wendorf and colleagues believed to be domestic cattle.<br/><br/>The bovid remains were of particular interest. Taking into account the context in which these remains were found, the remains could be from wild cattle (Bos primigenius), domestic cattle (B. primigenius f.
