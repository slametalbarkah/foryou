            Linda Magdalena Cullberg Lampenius (born 26 February 1970), better known by her maiden name Linda Lampenius and international stage name Linda Brava, is a Finnish classical concert violinist. Named as one of the most versatile and accomplished players of her generation, Brava has also performed pop, rock, folk, techno, film, jazz, and world music, among others.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Brava was born into a Swedish-speaking Finnish family in which music formed a vital part of life. Her father, Börje Lampenius (1921–2016), was a former theatre director, actor, singer, and also a composer of musicals and operettas. Her mother, Ulla Eklund, is a former actress and singer. Both of them worked at the Swedish Theatre in Helsinki.<br/><br/>At age three, Brava began to perform with her parents as a singer. Later on, in addition to her solo and orchestral performances, Brava would play the violin accompanied by her father on the piano, while her mother sang alongside them. In 1978, Vasabladet reported on Brava, a child violinist to remember, after her impressive solo concert appearance.<br/><br/>After leaving Finland in 1997, Brava has lived in Los Angeles, London, and Stockholm.
