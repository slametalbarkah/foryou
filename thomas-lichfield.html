In his professional practice he was known as Patrick Lichfield.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Thomas Patrick John Anson was born on 25 April 1939. He was the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas William Arnold Anson, Viscount Anson (1913–1958), the eldest son and heir apparent of Thomas Edward Anson, 4th Earl of Lichfield (1883–1960). His mother was born Anne Bowes-Lyon (1917–1980), a niece of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. His parents divorced in 1948, and his mother subsequently became Princess Anne of Denmark after her remarriage to Prince Georg of Denmark in 1950. He had one sister, Lady Elizabeth Georgiana Anson (1941–2020), who married Sir Geoffrey Adam Shakerley, 6th Baronet.<br/><br/>Lichfield was educated at two boarding independent schools: Wellesley House School in the coastal town of Broadstairs in Kent, and Harrow School in Harrow on the Hill in north-west London, followed by the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.<br/><br/>His father died in 1958, leaving Patrick to succeed as 5th Earl of Lichfield when his grandfather died in 1960.
