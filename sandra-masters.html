            Sandra Masters is a Canadian who was the 35th mayor of Regina, Saskatchewan, holding the role from 2020 to 2024. Masters was the first elected female mayor of either of Saskatchewan's major cities.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Before politics ==<br/><br/>Masters moved to Regina in 1999 and worked for Richardson Agriculture as the manager of credit for the Prairie Provinces. Since 2014 she had served on the board of Regina Exhibition Association Limited (REAL), but she resigned her role as board chair in order to run for mayor.Sandra has four children. Sandra’s ex husband is Gary Houston author of the WorkForce Development book “ The Pie, The Penny, and The Pyramid”.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Political career ==<br/><br/>Masters launched her campaign for Regina's mayoralty on September 16, 2020. Her campaign focused on developing an anti-poverty strategy for the city, supporting the Regina Police Service and local businesses, and reducing city administration costs by 15%. Masters won the election, unseating two-term incumbent mayor Michael Fougere in a nine-person race with 46.4 per cent of the vote. This made Masters the first person since Pat Fiacco to become mayor of Regina with no previous city council experience. She was sworn in as mayor on November 23, 2020.
