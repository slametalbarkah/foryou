<h1>Bob Loudon</h1>
            
            Robert Briton Loudon (24 March 1903 – 6 October 1991) was a New Zealand born rugby union player,  a flanker who made twenty-three representative appearances for the New South Wales state team in the 1920s. Seven of these matches have since been decreed as Test matches by the Australian Rugby Union and Loudon, who led the side in one such match in 1928, was therefore a captain of the Australian national team. After rugby union restarted in Queensland in 1929, and national selections were made from the two states Loudon played in six further full Australian Wallaby Test sides. In addition to his thirteen Test matches he made a further twenty-one tour match appearances for representative Australian sides on three international tours between 1923 and 1933.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Rugby career ==<br/><br/>Loudon, was born in Leeston, New Zealand and initially attended Christ's College, Christchurch. He relocated to Sydney during his youth and attended Sydney Grammar School. He was proficient in competitive Surf Life Saving at Sydney's Manly Beach and stroked the Manly Surf Club boat to win the national championship in 1927-28.<br/><br/>Loudon made his representative debut on the New South Wales tour to New Zealand in 1923 as a versatile back. He played in eight of the ten matches, including three Tests (one as a replacement). He appeared on tour as a centre, fullback and winger.
