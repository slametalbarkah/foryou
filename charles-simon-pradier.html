            Charles-Simon Pradier (25 May 1783 – 21 July 1847) was a Swiss engraver who also worked in France and Brazil. He was recognized as one of the leading engravers of his day. He collaborated with Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres on several works.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Life ==<br/><br/>Pradier was born on 25 May 1783 in Geneva, in the Republic of Geneva, into a family descended from Huguenot refugees from the Languedoc. His brother was the sculptor Jean-Jacques Pradier (1790–1852), better known as James Pradier. Pradier was a pupil of Auguste Gaspard Louis Desnoyers, who was in turn a pupil of Pierre Alexandre Tardieu (1756–1844). He was to become one of the most distinguished engravers of his day. Pradier became a member of the Drawing Committee of the Société des Arts in 1812, but was not active in it since he usually lived in Geneva.<br/><br/>Pradier was a member of the Missão Artística Francesa organized by Joachim Lebreton which brought a number of artists to Brazil, arriving on 25 March 1816. These included the painters Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768–1848) and Nicolas-Antoine Taunay (1755–1830), the sculptor Auguste Marie Taunay (1768–1824), the brothers Marc Ferrez (1788–1850) and Zepherin Ferrez (1797–1851) and the architect Grandjean de Montigny (1776–1850).
