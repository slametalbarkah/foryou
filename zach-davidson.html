<h1>Zach Davidson</h1>
            
            Zach Davidson (born July 15, 1998) is an American professional football tight end for the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Central Missouri Mules (where he played as punter as well) and was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the fifth round of the 2021 NFL draft.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life ==<br/><br/>Davidson grew up in Webb City, Missouri and attended Webb City High School. He was originally a backup tight end on Webb City's junior varsity team, but became the punter for the varsity team after the Cardinals' regular punter was suspended. He was an All-State selection as a junior and senior at punter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== College career ==<br/><br/>Davidson began his career at Central Missouri solely as a punter and redshirted his true freshman year. As a redshirt freshman, he set a school record and finished second in the nation with 44.3 yards per punt on 47 punts and was named second-team All-Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). The following season, Davidson was an honorable mention All-MIAA selection at punter and also served as the Mules second tight end, finishing the season with 11 catches for 239 receiving yards and three touchdowns. He had 40 receptions for 894 Yards and 15 touchdowns in his redshirt junior and was named first-team All-MIAA at both punter and tight end as well as a first-team All-American. Davidson opted to forgo his redshirt senior season, which was to be played in the spring due to COVID-19, and enter the 2021 NFL draft.
