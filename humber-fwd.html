            The Humber FWD is a British military off-road vehicle produced by the Humber company from 1941 to 1945. The primary version was the Humber 4×4 heavy utility, commonly known as the Box. It was also produced in variants such as a light off-road truck with a payload capacity of 8 cwt (400 kg) and an ambulance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History (heavy utility version) ==<br/><br/>The Humber FWD (four wheel drive, sometimes written as F.W.D.) was designed for the British Army after the outbreak of World War II. Its design was partly derived from the Humber Snipe passenger car, incorporating elements such as the engine, independent front suspension, and gearbox. The primary version was a heavy utility passenger off-road vehicle, officially designated as Car, Heavy Utility, 4x4 (FWD), Humber. It was the only four-wheel-drive passenger car produced in the United Kingdom during the war. Production began in May 1941 and continued until the end of the war, with approximately 6,500 units manufactured.<br/><br/>The Humber 4×4 heavy utility vehicles were mainly used as staff cars, sometimes equipped with radio stations. They saw service in the North African campaign and Western Europe. Users included the Royal Air Force Mountain Rescue Service, among others.
