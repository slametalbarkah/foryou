            Spectrum Road is the debut album by the American supergroup of the same name, featuring bassist and vocalist Jack Bruce, guitarist Vernon Reid, keyboard player John Medeski, and drummer Cindy Blackman Santana. The group's sole release, it was recorded in February 2011 at Maggie's Farm in Pipersville, Pennsylvania, and was issued in 2012 by Palmetto Records.

Reid reflected: "If this was focused on the so-called 'glories of the past' it would be dead on arrival. Since Tony's expression is only now being fully understood, we can take that momentum and run with it."<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Reception ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>In a review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek wrote: "Spectrum Road's self-titled debut delivers in full on the supergroup promise; in addition, they provide the kind of forward-looking tribute that a pioneer like Williams truly deserves."<br/><br/>Steve Greenlee of Jazz Times stated: "The 10-song program...
