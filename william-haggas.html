            William Haggas is a British Thoroughbred racehorse trainer, based at Somerville Lodge stables in Newmarket, Suffolk.  He is the son-in-law of the multiple champion jockey Lester Piggott.<br/><br/>He was educated at Harrow and played cricket at Lord's for Harrow against Eton in 1977, 1978 and 1979, captaining the side in the 1979 match. He started his working life in his father's textile factory, but quit after three months and headed to Newmarket. Before taking out a licence in his own right, he learnt his trade with John Winter and Mark Prescott.  He trained his first winner in 1987. As of June 2013, he had trained two British Classic winners – Shaamit, winner of the 1996 Derby, and Dancing Rain, winner of the 2011 Oaks.  The first of these came when he had just 40 horses in his stable. The second gave him the distinction of having two wins from his first two runners in the Epsom Classics. His third, Vow, came fourth in the 2012 Oaks.
