            Newtownshandrum GAA is a Gaelic Athletic Association club located in the small village of Newtownshandrum in County Cork, Ireland. The club, situated in half a parish of about 800 people, was founded in 1896 and is almost exclusively concerned with the game of hurling.<br/><br/>In senior hurling, Newtownshandrum compete annually in the Cork Senior Club Hurling Championship, which they have won four times as of 2009. The club, one of the few senior teams from the Avondhu division in the northern part of the county, also competes in various other championships in all grades within Cork.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Formation ===<br/><br/>The oldest piece of evidence which shows the existence of hurling in Newtownshandrum comes in the form of a medal inscribed 'Newtown Hurling Club 1896'. An old ballad is the first record of a Newtownshandrum hurling game played in nearby Milford. In spite of having a population of little more than 800 people, Newtownshandrum has become one of the most successful hurling clubs in Cork over the last decade, winning senior honours at Cork, Munster and All-Ireland levels.<br/><br/>2000: the big breakthrough<br/><br/>Four years after graduating from the intermediate grade, Newtownshandrum reached the championship decider in the senior grade of Cork hurling. In the final, former champions Erin's Own provided the opposition. Newtownshandrum triumphed on their first attempt in a county final, albeit in controversial circumstances as a late Erin's Own goal was disallowed.
