            Alexander Matthew Inglethorpe (born 14 November 1971) is an English former footballer who played as a forward for Watford, Leyton Orient, Exeter City and Barnet. He is now the Academy Director at Liverpool FC.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Playing career ==<br/><br/>Born in Epsom, England, Inglethorpe attended Howard of Effingham School in Surrey before beginning his playing career at Watford. Despite staying at the club for five years, he made only two starts and ten substitute appearances in league matches. Following a loan spell at Barnet in 1995, he signed for Leyton Orient. In 2000, he moved to Exeter City, where he ended his professional career following a brief loan spell at Canvey Island, for whom he played only a single match in the FA Cup.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Coaching career ==<br/><br/>Inglethorpe started his coaching career at Leatherhead in a player-manager role. While at Leatherhead he had to manage the team on a budget of just £500 a week. In his interview to James Pearce of the Chester Chronicle he included "While I was there, I worked in a warehouse and I coached the Under-18s at Lewisham College. I had 70 to 80 youngsters and a bag of balls and had to make the most of it. It was hard but they were good times."<br/><br/>Inglethorpe returned to Leyton Orient as U-19 coach in January 2004.
