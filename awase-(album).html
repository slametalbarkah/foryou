            Awase is an album by Nik Bärtsch's Ronin recorded in France in October 2017 and released by ECM in May 2018. The quartet features Sha on reeds while Thomy Jordi and Kaspar Rast were on the rhythm section<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Reception ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The PopMatters review by John Garratt noted "Ronin is now a quartet. Percussionist Andi Pupato has left, leaving Kaspar Rast to handle all of the drumming duties. Bassist Björn Meyer has been replaced by Thomy Jordi, meaning that the number of strings used on that particular instrument has dropped by two. The band had to re-train themselves to produce that tight-as-a-knot sound they were already known for. That led to some pleasant discoveries along the way.... The fact that three of Awase's six tracks pulled from Nik Bärtsch's past could give the false impression that he and Ronin are suffering from a creative drought. For other bands, that may be the case. Ronin vibrates on another frequency, where retooling an old song is just as refreshing to the ear as writing a whole new one. Slow evolution is still evolution."<br/><br/>AllMusic's Thom Jurek states, "Awase reveals Bärtsch's aesthetic methodology as instantly recognizable to anyone who has heard it before.
