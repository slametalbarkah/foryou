            The sternwheeler Charlotte was built in 1896 by Alexander Watson for the Northern British Columbia Navigation Company (NBCNC). The partners of the NBCNC were Stephen Tingley, Senator James Reid and John Irving. She was launched on August 3, 1896 and christened by James Reid's wife after whom she'd been named.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Soda Creek to Quesnel ==<br/><br/>The Charlotte was built to serve the route from Soda Creek to Quesnel on the upper Fraser River and was a far superior craft than either of her predecessors, the Enterprise and the Victoria which had worked that route during the 1860s through to the 1880s. <br/><br/>The Charlotte's first captain was Frank Odin. Due to her late launch, her first season was a short one and nearly disastrous. In mid November, Odin had taken her for one last run from Quesnel to Soda Creek and was on the way back when he discovered that ice was running down the river. Odin was forced to tie her up at Steamboat Landing near Alexandria, right in front of where the old hulk of the Victoria was. Not wanting to leave the Charlotte in the frozen river over the winter, her owners decided to buy the wreck from its owner, Robert McLeese, so the Charlotte could be safely berthed in her place.<br/><br/>For the next twelve years the Charlotte plied the route between Soda Creek and Quesnel, delivering the mail and other cargo for the pioneer communities.
