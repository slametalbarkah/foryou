            MasterChef Australia is an Australian competitive cooking reality show based on the original British MasterChef. It is produced by Endemol Shine Australia and screens on Network 10. <br/><br/>Restaurateur and chef Gary Mehigan, chef George Calombaris and food critic Matt Preston served as the show's original hosts and judges until 2019, when they were replaced by Series 4 winner and chef Andy Allen, food critic Melissa Leong, and restaurateur and chef Jock Zonfrillo. After Zonfrillo's sudden death and Leong’s departure, Allen was joined by Series 1 runner-up Poh Ling Yeow, food writer Sofia Levin and French chef Jean-Christophe Novelli.<br/><br/>The series has also spawned five spin-off series: Celebrity MasterChef Australia, which featured celebrity contestants, Junior MasterChef Australia, which featured younger contestants, MasterChef Australia All-Stars, which featured returning contestants from the first three series, MasterChef Australia: The Professionals, which featured professional chefs as contestants, and Dessert Masters, which featured professional pastry chefs.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Format ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>MasterChef Australia has a different format from that of the original British MasterChef and MasterChef Goes Large formats. Initial rounds consist of a large number of hopeful contestants from across Australia individually "auditioning" by presenting a food dish before the three judges in order to gain one of 50 semi-final places. Entrants must be over 18 years old and their main source of income cannot come from preparing and cooking fresh food in a professional environment.<br/><br/>The semi-finalists then compete in several challenges that test their food knowledge and preparation skills. In series 1, the top 50 competed until 20 were left, with the final 20 progressing to the main stage of the show.
