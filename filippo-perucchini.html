<h1>Filippo Perucchini</h1>
            
            Filippo Perucchini (born 6 October 1991) is an Italian professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Serie C Group B club Legnago.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Club career ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Milan ===<br/><br/>Born in Bergamo, Perucchini started playing football with local team Albinoleffe, before joining Milan in 2002. Throughout his time in the club's youth system, he has been a member of both the under-17 squad who won the Campionato Nazionale Allievi in 2007, and the under-20 side who won the Coppa Italia Primavera in 2010, 25 years after their last success. He was called up for some first team games since 2008, but eventually was never fielded.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Fano (loan) ====<br/><br/>In order to gain some first team experience, Perucchini was loaned out to Seconda Divisione club Fano for the 2010–11 season. He made his official debut for the club on 1 September 2010, in the fourth game of the Coppa Italia Lega Pro group stage against Celano, which Fano lost 3–1. On 26 September, he also made his league debut, replacing Alessandro Beni in the second half of a home match against San Marino. Perucchini went on to make a total of 14 league appearances for the club.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>==== Lecco &amp; Chieti (loan) ====<br/><br/>For the 2011–12 season, Perucchini was sent on loan to Lecco in Seconda Divisione, but he was called back in January after making only two league appearances and joined Chieti, another Seconda Divisione team, on loan for the remainder of the season. However, he still faced lack of playing time, making one single league appearance for his new club.
