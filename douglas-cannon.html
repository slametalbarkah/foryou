            The Douglas cannon is a missing cannon properly owned by Wesleyan University of Connecticut which was originally notable for being used in annual "cannon scraps" (contests to attempt to fire or prevent the firing of the cannon), but which in later years became known for being repeatedly stolen. The cannon, made of brass, weighs 140 pounds (64 kg) and is 29+1⁄2 inches (750 mm) long and 5+1⁄4 inches (130 mm) in diameter. It was originally mounted on a wooden carriage, but in 1931 it was mounted on a stone pedestal.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Nineteenth century ==<br/><br/>During the middle of the nineteenth century at Wesleyan, cannons were fired to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday. In 1859, the school calendar was changed such that school was not in session during the Fourth of <br/><br/>July holiday.<br/><br/>Prior to its acquisition by the college, the campus was occupied by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. As a result, several old cannons were partly buried in the ground as posts. In order to celebrate George Washington's birthday, one of these was dug up, cleaned, and fired in the early morning hours by some freshman students.<br/><br/>The early morning cannon fire was repeated in 1858, much to college president Joseph Cummings' annoyance. By 1860, though, an annual tradition was established in which members of the freshman class (first year students) would attempt to fire a cannon on the morning of February 22, while members of the sophomore class tried to prevent this from happening.
