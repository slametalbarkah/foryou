            Wasp Wings is a 42-minute 1945 Canadian documentary film made by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Overseas Film Unit and the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). The film takes its name from the colourful markings known as invasion stripes that were painted on Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft on D-Day, making them look like "angry wasps".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Synopsis ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Starting in England in 1943, Royal Canadian Air Force Spitfire fighter wings in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2TAF) were preparing for deployment to overseas bases. Using the fast and agile Spitfire in a number of different marks, the 2TAF aircraft provided close air support, as well as engaging the Luftwaffe in aerial combat. The Spitfire wings "played an essential part in a swift-moving, deadly striking air force." The success of the RCAF Spitfire units was due to both aircrews and ground crews that not only set up the tactical airfields, but kept the aircraft serviced. The first group set up in Italy, then other wings were attached to the units committed to the Normandy campaign, with temporary bases established in France, Belgium,<br/><br/>the Netherlands and Germany from 1944 to 1945. In the last months of the Second World War, 2TAF bagin to relax as their missions came to an end.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Production ==<br/><br/>Typical of the NFB's wartime series of documentary short films, Wasp Wings relied heavily on military assistance in obtaining footage at operational bases. The film was based on the 2nd Tactical Ar Force 126, 127, and 144 Wings and was compiled from film shot from 1943–1945.  The "men with flying in their blood" who were featured in Wasp Wings included Canadian Spitfire aces "Buzz" Beurling, Dal Russel, Keith Hodson, Robert Wendell "Buck" McNair, and Lloyd Chadburn.
