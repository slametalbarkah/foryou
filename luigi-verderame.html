            Luigi Verderame, usually known just as Luigi, is a Belgian singer,  popular internationally in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He sang mainly in French, but he also sang in Italian, Hebrew, Turkish and English. His most well known hits are Une Maman (1964) and Pitie (1967).<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Childhood ==<br/><br/>Luigi was born on July 9, 1950, in a small town near Liège, Belgium to parents that immigrated from Sicily. Luigi had three older brothers, and three sisters, and all of them were taught to enjoy singing and music. At the age of 8 Luigi learned to read sheet-music, and to play the clarinet and guitar. His three older brothers formed a band that played in cinemas, weddings and parties in their vicinity. In 1963, little Luigi (then only 13) joined his brothers' band as the lead singer to sing in a band competition.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Fame ==<br/><br/>In 1964, when Luigi was only 14, he recorded the song Une Maman (a mother, in French), which became a huge hit in Belgium and the rest of Europe, as well as in Turkey and in the Middle East. Because his surname was considered long and hard to remember, he became famous as just Luigi.
