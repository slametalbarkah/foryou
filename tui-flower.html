            Lucy Tui Hampton Aitken  (née Flower, 23 November 1925 – 15 August 2017), generally known as Tui Flower, was a pioneering New Zealand food writer. She has been described as "New Zealand's Julia Child".<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early life and family ==<br/><br/>Born in Matamata on 23 November 1925, Flower was the daughter of Leonard Flower, a postmaster, and Constance Ruby Irene Flower (née Mincher). She grew up in Matamata and Tauranga, and received her secondary education at Epsom Girls' Grammar School, where she was a boarder. In 1944, she went on to study at the University of Otago, obtaining a Diploma of Home Science.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Career ==<br/><br/>After leaving Otago, Flower taught home science at Pukekohe High School. In 1951, she travelled to the United States, where she attended a number of Cordon Bleu courses. She was awarded a bursary to study at the École hôtelière de Paris in 1954–55, and was subsequently employed by Unilever in Wellington as a home economist. In her nine years at Unilever she worked initially on laundry and cleaning products and packaging, and later on frozen, dehydrated and canned foods.<br/><br/>Visits to family in the United States exposed Flower to food journalism, and in 1965 she was appointed as the food editor of the New Zealand Woman's Weekly.
