            Robert Julian Dashwood (1899 – 5 September 1970) was a British-born Cook Islands writer and politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly between 1963 and 1966 and served in the territory's first two cabinets.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Biography ==<br/><br/>Dashwood was born in England in 1899, the son of a vicar.  During World War I he served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Following the war, a varied career saw him become a teacher in England, a farmer in Transvaal and a rubber plantation owner in Malaya. He also worked as a car salesman and shell dealer.<br/><br/>He relocated to the Cook Islands in 1929, where he became manager of a shop owned by A.B. Donald &amp; Co. Initially settling in Rakahanga, he later moved to Mauke, where he married a local woman named Kopu. He began writing under the pen name Julian Hillas (his mothers' maiden name), publishing books including I Know an Island and Today is Forever (republished as South Seas Paradise), as well as having several articles printed in Pacific Islands Monthly.<br/><br/>Dashwood was elected to Legislative Assembly from the Mauke constituency in a 1963 by-election.
