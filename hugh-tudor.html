Frederic Ensor, rector and patron of Lustleigh, Newton Abbot. The Ensors were a minor landed gentry family, of Rollesby Hall, near Norwich, Norfolk.<br/><br/>Tudor enrolled in the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1888.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early career: India and South Africa ==<br/><br/>Tudor was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Horse Artillery on 25 July 1890. He was stationed in India from 1890 until 1897, when he returned to England, having been promoted to lieutenant on 25 July 1893.<br/><br/>Tudor was sent to South Africa during the Second Boer War where he was badly wounded at the Battle of Magersfontein (11 December 1899), but recovered and returned to duty, and was promoted to captain on 7 February 1900. He served as divisional adjutant and was mentioned in despatches (including the final despatch by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902).
